            <p>I am Ahsan Siddiqui, a passionate and dedicated student pursuing a Computer Science degree from Habib University. I had interest in programming since I was in school and through my CS degree from Habib, I aim to further my interests in Game Development and AI. Throughout my journey at Habib, I have honed my programming skills in python and also gained problem solving skills which is not only important in the world of programming but also in life.
                Even though I am pursuing a CS degree, I do not plan to give up on my other dreams and goals. One of them is Video Editing and vfx. I have been in this field since 2017 and I can say that I am a profession video editor with complete grasp of software like Adobe After Effects and Premier pro and Sony Vegas. I have also used this skill for freelancing on fiverr and Facebook.<br><br>
                Moreover, closely linked to the world of video editing is video animation. I have briefly looked into the field of 3D animation by using software like Blender and Unreal Engine. Even though my intention of learning to use these applications was for the purpose of 3D animation, I believe that it will also help me in my distant goals of becoming a Game Developer.<br><br>
                Lastly, I am currently learning Front-End Web development from Codecademy. I have completely learnt HTML ,CSS and JavaScript. It is not long before I learn redux and react and finally complete this course as one of my potential career paths.
